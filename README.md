# AntiAFK
This is my 3rd program in C#.  I recently noticed while gaming that if i was idle for too long my video card would crash, so I created a program that simulates pressing the "alt" key, thus tricking the computer into thinking im not idle.  This also works on various MMOs just start and run in the background. NOTE# be sure your ALT key isn't bound to anything important as the interval will send the ALT key every 59 secs. 
This also may or may not work with the Skype system at work, which managers often use to see if you're goofing off or napping in your office.
